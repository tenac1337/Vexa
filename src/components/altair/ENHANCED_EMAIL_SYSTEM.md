# Enhanced Email System with Gemini 1.5 Pro

## Overview

The Enhanced Email System transforms how emails are composed and sent by using **Gemini 1.5 Pro** as an AI middleware to generate comprehensive, professional emails from minimal context. Instead of requiring users to write complete emails, they simply provide the purpose and context, and the AI generates polished, well-structured emails automatically.

- Creates both plain text and HTML versions automatically
- Intelligent subject line generation when not provided

### âœ¨ **Smart Context Understanding**
- Purpose-driven email generation
- Tone adaptation (professional, friendly, formal, casual)
- Content expansion from key points
- Context-aware email structure

### ðŸŽ¯ **Professional Quality**
- Proper email etiquette and formatting
- Appropriate greetings and closings
- Clear, actionable content
- Consistent Vexa branding signature
